## Abstract

This document describes the results and recommendations that have been derived from setting up a test bed with OGC API features conform INSPIRE at the Dutch hosting organization PDOK (Publieke Dienstverlening Op de Kaart, https://www.pdok.nl).
The aim of setting up this test bed is to stimulate the INSPIRE data providers and hosting organizations to start publishing INSPIRE data as OGC API Features. By doing this, a greater goal is reached: A better use of Inspire data. Secondly it hopes te contribute to the Inspire community.

The approach was to predefine requirements, setup a week of strong collaboration (High5) with data provider Dutch Kadaster, hosting organization PDOK and Geonovum to build a OGC API feature service on the dataset of Dutch Addresses.
The results is a working OGC API feature service: https://api.pdok.nl/geonovum/oaf/v1_0/, with a description of the compliance to the predefined requirements.
The most important recommandations for the hosting organizations is to stimulate dataproviders to start with OGC API features. Data providers are recommended to first orientate on the possible work of other member states in this field. The INSPIRE community needs a central organization for the mapping of the complex data models to more simple encodings which are in most cases the basis of the OGC API features.
